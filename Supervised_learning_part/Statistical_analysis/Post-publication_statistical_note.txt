Post-publication statistical note. We initially compared models to the baseline using the unpaired Mannâ€“Whitney U test on per-fold accuracies. 
Because 10-fold CV was run with StratifiedKFold(..., shuffle=True, random_state=123), the test folds were identical across models (paired data); 
within each fold, the train/validation split was reshuffled, which adds minor training noise but does not affect the shared test indices and does not cause leakage. 
In this light, an unpaired test treats paired observations as independent and is typically conservative - lower power. For paired per-fold test accuracies 
we favor the Wilcoxon test and controlling multiple baseline comparisons, not assuming normal distrubution; 
where the differences appear approximately normal, paired t-tests yield consistent conclusions. 
The absolute ranking by point estimates (DenseNet121-pretrained-HSV > baseline) is unchanged.
