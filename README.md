This repository contains codes for automatic deep learning glioma grading using supervised learning approach and the protocol for weakly supervised learning, discovering and quantifying tumor microenvironment features. 
The protocol implements patch-contrastive learning approach and the interpretable ensemble of neural networks. The tumor-microenvironment-protocol part is based on: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841522000366

Results from the experiments are described in the article: Pytlarz, M., Wojnicki, K., Pilanc, P. et al.
