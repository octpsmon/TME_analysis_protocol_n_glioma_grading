This repository contains codes for automatic deep learning glioma grading using ResNet-18 and the protocol for learning, discovering and quantifying tumor microenvironment features. 
The protocol implements patch-contrastive learning approach and the interpretable ensemble of neural networks. The tumor-microenvironment-protocol part based on: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841522000366

Results from the experiments are described in the article: "Deep Learning Glioma Grading with the Tumor Microenvironment Analysis Protocol for A Comprehensive Learning, Discovering, and Quantifying Microenvironmental Features", M. Pytlarz, K. Wojnicki, P. Pilanc, B. Kaminska, A. Crimi.
