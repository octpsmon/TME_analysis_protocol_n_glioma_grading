This repository contains codes for automatic deep learning glioma grading using supervised learning approach and the protocol for (weakly supervised) learning, discovering and quantifying tumor microenvironment features. 
The protocol implements patch-contrastive learning approach and the interpretable ensemble of neural networks. The tumor-microenvironment-protocol part is based on: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841522000366

The dataset, “Glioma - Human Leukocyte Antigen Tissue Microarray. Data from: Deep Learning Glioma Grading with the Tumor Microenvironment Analysis Protocol for Comprehensive Learning, Discovering, and Quantifying Microenvironmental Features,” is available in the Zenodo repository and can be accessed at https://zenodo.org/records/10807474.

Results from the experiments are described in the article: Pytlarz, M., Wojnicki, K., Pilanc, P. et al.

Despite the small dataset and the challenge of distinguishing between WHO grades 2 and 3, the analysis successfully identified distinct phenotypic neighborhoods, particularly highlighting the significance of neighborhoods N2 and N4 in differentiating malignant gliomas. We investigated pathological aspects of grade progression, focusing on increased myeloid cell accumulation. Our findings suggest that automatic grading could significantly enhance intraoperative assessments and immunotherapies planning.
